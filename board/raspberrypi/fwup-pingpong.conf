# Firmware configuration file for the Raspberry Pi
#
# This configuration provides a SDCard/eMMC layout and firmware update
# image that supports ping/pong updates. I.e., there are two partitions
# that contain the application, but only one is in use at a time. When it
# is time to apply a firmware update, the update is written to the unused
# partition. After the write completes successfully, the system is updated
# so that the formerly unused partition is now active.
